    <h1>How To Read This Report</h1>
    <p>This page describes how to read the IIS Test Results. This report gives quick view of 
    how the interface responds when receiving VXU messages. This report is preliminary and to 
    be used to inform both national and local standardization efforts. This report is not a 
    complete nor definitive statement on the quality or abilities of an IIS interface. </p>
    
    <h3>General Limitations of Report</h3>
    <p>This report has been generated for information purposes as the preliminary first step 
    to assessing HL7 capabilities at the IIS level. This report has the following critical 
    limitations, which must be carefully noted:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This report is preliminary and exploratory so includes tests where there is yet no 
      definitive standard on the correct response expected from the IIS.</li>
      <li>This report may have technical issues that are yet to be discovered and fixed.</li>
      <li>Due to the variance and differences in acknowledgement messages returned from IIS, 
      the report may not accurately report whether a VXU was actually accepted or not.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Purposes of Report</h3>
    <p>The primary purpose of this report is to provide information at the national level about 
    how IIS are currently operating. This information will be used primarily to recommend 
    improvements to the national standard. IIS may also use some of the information in this 
    report to inform changes to the IIS. However, IIS should take care to note that this 
    report is preliminary and differences or problems noted do not assert that the IIS is 
    operating incorrectly or needs to be changed. As such this report should be reviewed as 
    preliminary and with the expectation that the information gained in this report will be 
    used to inform improvements to the standards and the development of a standardized 
    testing process. These improvements are likely to take several years and involve 
    input from the entire community, this report is built to support the first step in this 
    process.</p>
    
    <h3>IIS Interopability Testing Project</h3>
    <p>This report is a key aspect of the American Immunization Registry Association (AIRA) Interopability
    Testing project. The following diagram shows the process that is being followed in this project: </p>
    <img src="IIS Gap Analysis Process.png" width="700"/>
    <p>The milestones are described as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>IIS Agrees to Real-time Testing</b>: 
        IIS signed up for real-time testing.</li>
      <li><b>Guide Received</b>: 
        Guide is received by AIRA. AIRA can now record local requirements. </li>
      <li><b>Credentials Received</b>: 
        Credentials and connecting information is received by AIRA. AIRA can now connect to IIS for testing. </li>
      <li><b>Local Requirements Recorded</b>: 
        AIRA reads the local requirements guide and records key details, such as which fields are required, in the AIRA
        testing system. </li>
      <li><b>Connected to IIS</b>: 
        AIRA configures the testing system to connect to the IIS test system. Once complete AIRA is able to submit
        HL7 VXU messages and receive acknowledgements from the IIS. </li>
      <li><b>Configure Automated Report</b>: 
        The AIRA testing system is setup to create the automated report this document describes. </li>
      <li><b>Feedback Document Created</b>: 
        AIRA staff will use the information in the automated report to generate a feedback document for the IIS. </li>
      <li><b>EHR Configuration Documented</b>: 
        At some point AIRA will use this information to provide configuration guidance to EHR systems working to 
        connect to IIS in general. </li>
      <li><b>Feedback Shared with IIS</b>: 
        Feedback document and the original report will be shared with the IIS. AIRA will be sharing results each month as reports 
        are automatically run.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div id="overallScore"/>
    <h2> Overall Score</h2>
    <p>This score is to designed to show improvements over time and point to areas that need 
    to be addressed in either the national or local standard. The score is designed to be 
    very sensitive thus most, if not all IIS, are not expected to necessarily receive a good 
    score at this point in the process.</p>
    
    <h3>Limitations of Score</h3>
    <p>This score can not be used to compare one IIS to another, nor is the score definitive 
    in meaning. This score was developed to aid in readability of the report. It should only 
    be used help focus the reader on sections of interest and to provide a way of detecting 
    when major changes occur across time to a particular IIS.</p>
    
    <h3>Report Sections</h3>
    <p>The report is made of eight sections. Each section has a score and these are weighted 
    and added together for an overall score. Here is the breakdown:</p>
    
    <table border="1" cellspacing="0">
      <tr>
        <th>Report Section</th>
        <th>Weight</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Interoperability</td>
        <td>40%</td>
        <td>IIS must accept all 7 NIST test message (original Interoperability Status Check)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Coded Values</td>
        <td>20%</td>
        <td>IIS should accept codes defined by CDC in the implementation guide</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Local Requirement</td>
        <td>10%</td>
        <td>IIS should support locally defined requirements</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>National Compatibility</td>
        <td>10%</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Tolerance Test</td>
        <td>5%</td>
        <td>IIS should tolerate some expected or common issues</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

        <td>5%</td>
        <td>IIS should accept messages typically sent by certified EHR systems</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Performance Test</td>
        <td>5%</td>
        <td>IIS should respond to ACK messages within a reasonable amount of time</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Acknowledgment Conformance Test</td>
        <td>5%</td>
        <td>IIS should send ACK messages that conform to national requirements.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <div id="interoperability"/>
    <h2>Interoperability</h2> 
    <p>This is the automated version of the IIS Interoperability Status Check. The 
    score is the percentage of tests that were accepted without having the messages 
    changed so much that the original core data is not sent to the IIS.</p>
    <p>Please note that a score of 100% does not indicate that the IIS is completely 
    interoperable. It only indicates that the testing interface can be configured in 
    such a way that all data sent was apparently accepted. Analysis of configuration 
    taken to connect needs to be reviewed manually to evaluate the changes made in 
    context of national standards and NIST testing. </p>


    <div id="codedValues"/>
    <h2>Coded Values</h2> 
    <p>For just about every coded value in the guide a message is sent to verify if 
    the IIS will accept the message with the code in it. The score for this section 
    is on a logarithmic scale, such that every message rejected dramatically reduces 
    the score at first and then less so as the number increases. This means that it 
    is expected that IIS will accept most if not all codes, and missing even a few 
    drastically reduces the score. </p>

    <div id="localRequirements"/>
    <h2>Local Requirements</h2> 
    <p>The test compares the documented Usage according to your IG against the detected Usage 
    discovered through testing with your interface. Difference are shown in the table below.</p>
    <h3>Discovery Process</h3>
    <p>The local requirements gathered previous to testing are used to create a set 
    of test cases, messages with and without each field. In this way the tester can 
    determine whether a field:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Must be present</li>
      <li>May or may not be present</li>
      <li>Must be absent</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By doing this testing the process can verify R, RE, O, and X requirements. 
    (Although this testing process cannot verify the difference between RE and O.) </p>
    
    <h3>Conditional Status</h3>
    <p>HL7 guides use a special conditional status (e.g. C(R/X) or C(R/O)) to indicate 
    status for fields that must be populated when certain conditions are met. The testing
    process being used by AIRA does not directly support testing conditional fields. 
    Conditional fields are expressed by two or more tests that together express the 
    different situations when the field may be required. </p>
    <p> For example, PID-25 Birth Order has a status of C(RE/O). When PID-30 is valued
    Y, indicating the patient is part of a multiple birth, then PID-25 has an effective
    status of RE and the birth order should be populated if known. Otherwise 
    birth order is an optional field. In the AIRA testing process this field is 
    represented by two different tests: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>PID-25 Single, status O</li>
      <li>PID-25 Multiple, status RE</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In this way the AIRA testing system can test the requirements for this field in
    both situations. Implementation guide authors should continue to use conditional 
    status but be aware that this report breaks them down in this manner. </p>
    
    <h3>Special Status Codes</h3>
    <p>The status field indicates the ideal and the intended  use of the field but does
    not capture certain aspects of implemented systems that are sometimes documented
    in the implementation guide and which are certainly noticed when interacting with 
    real HL7 interfaces. To capture some of these concepts the AIRA testing process
    has invented the following temporary status codes: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>R* Required, but not enforced</b>: 
        The guide indicates the field is required but if the field is left empty the IIS 
        will still accept the message. For example, PID-1 is documented as required by the IIS
        but the IIS will accept messages with no value in PID-1. Please note that 
        IIS may accept a message even if a required field is not valued. The standard only
        indicates that an IIS "shall" return an error (which can also be a warning) when a 
        required field is empty. While
        it is recommended that the IIS at least indicate that required fields were missing, 
        the IIS is free to continue to accept part or all of the data that was sent. 
        </li>
      <li><b>RE* Required, but may be empty and is not read</b>:
        The guide indicates the field should be valued if known, but that the IIS is not
        reading this field. For example, PID-22 Ethnic Group is documented as required if known
        by the IIS, but the IIS has not yet implemented support for reading it. However the IIS
        plans to implement the field in the future.  
        </li>
      <li><b>O* Optional, and is not read</b>:
        The guide indicates that the field may be valued but the IIS does not read the field. 
        For example, the PID-15 Primary Language field is documented as optional by the IIS
        but the IIS does not read this field. The data may be sent by the data will 
        never be recorded by the IIS. </li>
      <li><b>X* Not supported, but not enforced</b>:
        The guide indicates that a field must not be valued but the IIS will accept the 
        message even if it is valued. For example, PID-2 Patienet ID is documented as not supported,
        by the IIS, but the IIS will not generate an error if PID-2 is valued. Please note that
        HL7 standards indicate that an IIS "may" generate an error if a not supported field 
        is valued. This means not supported fields are valued.  </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Explanation of Results</h3>
    <p>To save space only tests that were not successful are shown in the table. The columns
    are described as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Field</b>: 
        The name of the field being tested. Please note that for testing purposes the fields may be prepended
        or appended with modifiers that qualify that the field is being tested under specific circumstances. For 
        example "Admin RXA-6" indicates the testing results when RXA-6 was being tested when reporting 
        and administered vaccination.  </li>
      <li><b>Description</b>:
        Human readable description of the field. Please note that because this table has been truncated, and
        not all rows shown, the
        descriptions preceded by the indent and dash may not flow under the row directly above. </li>
      <li><b>Usage</b>: 
        The usage as indicated in the local implementation guide. </li>
      <li><b>Detected</b>: 
        The usage that the testing has detected. Please note that there are limitations to what 
        can be detected (testing can not yet differentiate between how an IIS process RE and O fields) and how 
        well the testing process reads the acknowledgment (variance in acknowledgements means that it is difficult for the 
        tester to always understand exactly what happened.)</li>
      <li><b>Status</b>:
        This field indicates whether the Usage matches what was documented in the local guide. In this report
        the table is truncated so that all rows shown are inconsistent. </li>
      <li><b>Field Present</b>: 
        Reports on status of the test case to submit a message with the field valued. From here the user can
        click through to see the message that was submitted and the details of why the test failed. </li>
      <li><b>Field Absent</b>: 
        Reports on status of the test case to submit a message with the field NOT valued. From here the user can
        click through to see the message that was submitted and the details of why the test failed. </li>
    </ul>

    <div id="nationalCompatibility"/>
    <h2>National Compatibility</h2> 
    <p>This test differs from the previous ones in that it does not run any tests 
    against the IIS. In this case it compares the <em>detected local requirements</em> against the 
    national requirements to look for differences and incompatibilities. </p>
    <h3>Detected Local Requirements</h3>
    <p>This section uses the local requirements as they have been modified by the previous testing phase.
    The modifications to the local requirements is termed "detected local requirements". These detected status
    are temporary, only used for the report and this next section and are not stored for future use.  
    </p>
    <h3>Identified Compatibility Issues</h3>
    <p>If the detected local standard matches the national standard, no details are given here. If they 
    detected local standard differs from the national standard it is categorized according to severity
    and reported here. Please note that this report is automated and preliminary and should only be 
    used to identify potential problems. More investigation will be needed to confirm the issues that
    are found here. </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Local Standard has Major Conflict with National Standards (MAJOR CONFLICT)</b>: 
        Stated local requirement conflicts with national requirements. Conformance to the 
        local specification will mean non-conformance to national specification. Nationally 
        certified systems will not be interoperable with local system. </li>
      <li><b>Local Standard Conflicts with National Standards (CONFLICT)</b>: 
        Stated local requirement conflicts with national requirements. Conformance to the 
        local specification will mean non-conformance to national specification. However, 
        interoperability is still possible for nationally certified systems.</li>
      <li><b>Local Standard Defines Hard Constraint on National Standard (MAJOR CONSTRAINT)</b>: 
        Stated local requirement goes beyond national requirement, nationally certified 
        systems have not been tested to support this requirement. Local constraints are 
        allowed by the national standard. Interoperability will probably require changes 
        to meet local requirements. </li>
      <li><b>Local Standard Defines Constraint on National Standard (CONSTRAINT)</b>: 
        Stated local requirement goes beyond national requirement, nationally certified 
        systems have not been tested to support this requirement. Local constraints are 
        allowed by the national standard. Interoperability may still be possible. </li>
      <li><b>Local Standard Loosens National Constraints (ALLOWANCE)</b>: 
        Stated local requirement allows for non-standard usage, meaning that national 
        requirements were relaxed, nationally certified messages should be accepted 
        but local guide is not in conformance with national standard. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Reading the Tables</h3>
    <p>Each table column should be read as follows: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Field</b>: 
        The name of the field. </li>
      <li><b>Description</b>: 
        The human readable description of the field. Please note that the indented fields 
        with dashes may not necessarily flow under the row shown above it. </li>
      <li><b>CDC Usage</b>: 
        The national usage as defined in the CDC implementation guide. </li>
      <li><b>Detected Usage</b>: 
        The detected local usage. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Generating the Score</h3>
    <p>The scoring for this section is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If there is at least one CONFLICT then the total score is reduced by 5% (but score can not go below 0%)</li>
      <li>If there is at least one MAJOR CONFLICT then total score is 0%</li>
      <li>or if there is at least one MAJOR CONSTRAIT then the total score is 70%</li>
      <li>or if there is at least one CONSTRAINT then the total score is 80%</li>
      <li>or if there is at least one ALLOWANCE then the total score is 90%</li>
      <li>or the score is 100%</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The idea behind this scoring scheme is that MAJOR CONFLICTS means the local site is 
    completely incompatible with the national standard and any EHR that successfully meets 
    the local requirements will not be able to meet national requirements. If there is a 
    MAJOR CONSTRAINT then the local site has legally added local requirements that must 
    be implemented but which are not required at the national level. If there is a 
    CONSTRAINT interoperability is still possible with some provisos. If there is an 
    ALLOWANCE the local site has relaxed requirements and important information may be 
    lost in the exchange but the IIS should still be interoperable. </p>

    <div id="tolerance"/>
    <h2>Tolerance</h2> 
    <p>There are a small set of messages that have minor issues that should or could be 
    ignored by the IIS. Some of these are future functionality that may be seen in the 
    future. During testing in 2013 it was shown that many IIS were unprepared to ignore 
    OBX segments they didn't recognize. This test ensures that IIS are ready for changes 
    that may come in the future. The score for this section is based on a percentage of 
    messages accepted. It is not expected that IIS would accept all the tolerance 
    messages as there is not a clear definition of what should or should not be accepted. </p>

    <div id="ehrExamples"/>
    <h2>EHR Examples</h2> 
    <p>A set of EHR example messages are sent. The score is a percentage of accepted messages. </p>

    <div id="performance"/>
    <h2>Performance</h2> 
    <p>There is no set standard for performance. It has been observed that many IIS are able 
    to respond to updates within one or two seconds, while some others can take much longer. 
    While a slow response time is not necessarily an interoperability problem, it is most
    useful if an IIS is able to respond quickly. For the purposes of the report the average
    response time standard has been set at three seconds. It should be further noted that
    this performance is not necessarily indicative of performance on the IIS machine in 
    production. This information is provided only because it can be easily observed during
    testing and so is being reported here for the benefit of the IIS and other partners.  
    </p>
    <p>This scoring of this section looks at the performance of all updates sent in the previous tests. 
    Currently the score is 100% if the messages were responded to within 3 seconds on average. 
    If the average response was between 3 and 6 seconds then score is a linear percentage with 
    3 seconds at 100% and 6 seconds at 0%.  </p>

    <div id="acknowledgmentConformance"/>
    <h2>Acknowledgement Conformance</h2> 
    <p>This section looks at all of the acknowledgements received back and verifies if they meet the 
    standard for format. The score is the percentage of messages that had no issues in format. </p>
