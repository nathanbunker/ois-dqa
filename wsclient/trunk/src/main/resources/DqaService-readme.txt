Changes to the web service interface should be done to the following files: 
src/main/resources/DqaService.wsdl
src/main/resources/DqaService.xsd

Do NOT edit the following files as they are the Eclipse generated versions
of the above files:
src/main/webapp/DqaServiceSOAP.wsdl
src/main/webapp/DqaService.xsd

This preserves the source wsdl/schema files and prevents Eclipse from 
corrupting them during the code generation process.
